Most recent update: 21.08.25

Installation
1. Install a Python IDE: We recommend Visual Studio Code or Replit.
2. Download main.py.
3. Run it in your IDE.

Use
1. When you open you app, you will receive a prompt ("Do you want to convert to binary or decimal?"). Type "binary" or "decimal". (Only type your text lowercase, the program will not accept your wording if any letter is uppercase. This is an issue with Python, not with the code itself.)
2. Type in your number.
3. Done.
